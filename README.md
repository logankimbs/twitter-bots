# Twitter Bots

This project uses [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) to connect to the Twitter API. Once connected, each of the three bots perform their tasks.

1. The Follow Followers Bot automatically follows any account who follows me.
2. The Favorite & Retweet Bot automatically like and retweets tweets that match a certain criteria.
3. The Reply to Mentions Bot automatically replies to tweets mentioning me that contain certain key words.
